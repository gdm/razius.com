*Move fast and break things* is one of the `founding mantras`_ of
Facebook and I think it defines a company culture that can apply to
almost any technology startup. It is a culture who's principles embody,
promote and encourage communication, constant and fast iterations, tight
feedback loop between the implementation and the design, short
code-to-deployment cycles, experimentation and efficiency.

These are also just a few of the reasons why I chose to be a part of the
`Iconfinder`_ team and to do my internship at a startup company instead
of a traditional one. I have the perfect environment for rapid
professional growth, I can acquire new skills and sharpen my old ones at
a much faster pace, I feel challenged everyday and I have the pleasure
of working with the newest technologies.

In this *move fast and break things* culture the *break things*, as I've
come to find out, is not optional. To continue to improve you have to
make mistakes from which you have to learn and my recent blunder is one
of those mistakes. During the development of the new comment section a
`serious bug`_ slipped through making it possible for attackers to
hijack cookies from users. The bug was discovered and fixed under 2
hours and didn't have any major repercussions apart from the
inconvenience of clearing the session storage and having all users log
in again.

I've learned a lot this month, some lessons where learned the hard way,
from mistakes, but it's been a fun ride so far and I can't wait to see
what the future will bring.
